# Freelance Escrow Smart Contract

This is a **Solidity-based escrow smart contract** designed to facilitate **secure freelance transactions**. It helps clients and freelancers handle payments safely, releasing funds only when work is confirmed.

## Features:
- Client deposits funds into the escrow contract.
- Freelancer is notified and begins work.
- Client can confirm work completion, releasing funds to the freelancer.
- In case of disputes, both parties can raise a dispute, and the contract can resolve it by releasing funds to the winner.

## How It Works:
1. **Deploy the contract** with the freelancer's Ethereum address.
2. **Client deposits funds** into the escrow contract.
3. **Freelancer completes work** and confirms completion.

5. **Raise a dispute** if thereâ€™s any disagreement between client and freelancer.
